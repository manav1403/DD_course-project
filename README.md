# DD_course-project
Designing a Smart Traffic Light System using the knowledge gained in the course under guidance of professor Nitin Bhatia.

# Overview
Unlike other dynamic control signals that adjust the timing and phasing of lights according to limits that are set in controller programming, this system combines existing technology with artificial intelligence.The signals communicate with each other and adapt to changing traffic conditions to reduce the amount of time that cars spend idling.
The units could could easily be scaled horizontally which leads to development of only one units which could be attached to other units creating a sync loop of variable number of traffic light units.
The system should also be able to handle any emergency  changes/reset such as  for VIP movements and ambulance emergencies etc.

# Motivation
Romanian and US research teams believe that the time spent by motorists waiting for lights to change could be reduced by over 28% with the introduction of smart traffic lights and that CO2 emissions could be cut by as much as 6.5%.
A major use of Smart traffic lights could be as part of public transport systems. The signals can be set up to sense the approach of buses or trams and change the signals in their favour, thus improving the speed and efficiency of sustainable transport modes.

# More work needed to be done
